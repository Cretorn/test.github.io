Timing allows you task and starts it at a specific time interval.

e.g. Certain javascript function run every 5 seconds, click a button and then 3 seconds later a message will pop up


on the HTML page:


  <button onClick="setTimeout()">Click me</button>

This accesses a function from javascript called setTimeout(), which sets a timer and allows us to specify how long the timer would be, and when the time runs out, it will execute a javascript
function.

  <button onClick="setTimeout(sayHi, 3000)">Click me</button>         <!--Time is unit by milliseconds, 3000 would be 3 seconds -->


And after that you would create the sayHi() function in yo js:


    function sayHi(){
		alert("hi");
	}

Result:

Click button, and after 3 seconds it alerts "Hi".


In addition to setTimeout(), there is another function called setInterval(), you can use it to execute the function off the interval, e.g. pops up every two seconds.
